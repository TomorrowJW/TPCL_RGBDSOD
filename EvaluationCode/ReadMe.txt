Just run the main.m to get the S-measure, E-measure, F-measure, and MAE score.
Then you can run the Plot_curve.m code to generate the PR Curve. You can also download our 
pre-runing mat file from our website: http://dpfan.net/d3netbenchmark/.

If the you use our code please cite the related works.
